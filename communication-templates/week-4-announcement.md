SAML authentication with GitHub is now enabled.

To maintain access, every user will need to:

1. To access Org via GitHub website, users will need to authorize access using the SAML SSO page
2. To continue to access repositories via SSH, you need to use the website to give your SSH key permission to access Org.
3. To continue to using personal access tokens with the GitHub API, you need to use the website to give each token permission to access Org.

**The deadline for this is XXX.** Failure to authenticate to GitHub via SAML will result in removal from the GitHub organization and loss of access to all resources and work.
