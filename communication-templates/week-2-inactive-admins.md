# Inactive Admins

_To be sent to inactive admins_

As the GitHub Administrators (+ SAML administrators, + IT Security team), we are planning a roll-out of SAML authentication with GitHub Enterprise. This will take place over the next 6 weeks. We would like to share the anticipated plan, to ensure the smoothest transition possible. You will receive separate communication with more details about how this affects your user access.

You are receiving this email because you have been identified as an inactive administrator on at least one repository. As a part of this transition, we will be downgrading unnecessary administrator access.

Please review the access listed below, and respond to this email if you still need to maintain administrator access to these resources. If access is no longer needed, no action is necessary at this time.
