# Communication templates

These templates are for organizations transitioning to enforce SAML authentication with GitHub.

## How to use these templates

#### [Week 1: Manager](./week-1-manager.md)

From: Admins
To: Engineering managers
This email is the first step in communication. This introduces the roll-out plan, and asks managers for any information that may impact the roll-out, including any volunteer early test groups.

#### [Week 2: Users](./week-2-admin-to-users.md)

From: Admins
To: Engineers and GitHub users
This email introduces all users to the roll-out plan. The primary asks are for:
- Volunteer early test user groups
- Information around admin access, and bot/service accounts

#### [Week 2: Inactive admins](week-2-inactive-admins.md)

From: Admins
To: Users with inactive or suspicious admin access
This email asks users with certain admin access to confirm their need to have continued admin access to those resources in the future.

#### [Week 3: Test users](week-3-test-users.md)

From: Admins
To: Test users
This email gives test users instructions for authenticating to GitHub via SAML.

#### [Week 4: Announcement](week-4-announcement.md)

From: Admins

This email is sent after SAML is enabled. This communication clarifies deadlines and instructions for users to authenticate properly and maintain access.

#### [Week 5: Managers to users](week-5-manager-to-users.md)

From: Managers
To: Engineers & GitHub users that have not yet authenticated via SAML
This is the first of two escalations prompting users who have not yet authenticated via SAML to do so immediately

#### [Week 5: CTO to users](week-5-cto-to-users.md)

From: CTO
To: Engineers & GitHub users that have not yet authenticated via SAML
This is the second of two escalations prompting users who have not yet authenticated via SAML to do so immediately

#### [Week 6: All](week-6-all.md)

From: Admins
To: Engineers, GitHub users, and managers
This is the final communication, sharing that SAML will be enforced shortly. It also includes instructions on what to do if access is lost.
