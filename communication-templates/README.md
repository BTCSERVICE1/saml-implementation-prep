These templates are for organizations transitioning to enforce SAML authentication with GitHub.

## How to use these templates

#### [Week 2: Users](/communication-templates/week-2-admin-to-users.md)

From: Admins

This email introduces all users to the roll-out plan. The primary asks are for:

#### [Week 2: Inactive admins](/communication-templates/week-2-inactive-admins.md)
