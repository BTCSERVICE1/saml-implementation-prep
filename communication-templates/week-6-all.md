# Final SAML announcement

---

Thank you for your cooperation during our transition to enforce SAML with GitHub. SAML authentication to GitHub will be enforced shortly.

**Granting access to keys**

1. To continue to access repositories via SSH, you need to use the website to give your SSH key permission to access Org. (Settings > SSH and GPG keys > authorize specific keys for orgs)
2. To continue to using personal access tokens with the GitHub API, you need to use the website to give each token permission to access Org. (Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Authorize specific tokens for orgs)

**Future onboarding process**

In the future, when a user is provisioned GitHub in the SAML IdP, they will receive an GitHub Organization invite email from GitHub. The user should click on the link in the email and complete the SSO flow. This will be the standard for all new users once SAML authentication is enforced.

**"I'm locked out!"**

If you did not meet the deadline to authenticate, please reply to this email to contact our GitHub administrators.
